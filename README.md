- **No Tracking**: No user data is collected or transmitted

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Weather data not loading**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your API key is correct in the JS files
   - Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions

2. **Alerts not working**
   - Check browser notification permissions
